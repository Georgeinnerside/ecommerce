# Ecommerce Project

Layout Approach
The product cards were arranged using Flexbox . This ensures they align neatly in rows and wrap automatically on smaller screens.Inoticed some cards were bigger than others The space-around property keeps consistent spacing between cards, and equal height is maintained with align-items: stretch.

Responsiveness Considerations
The design adapts naturally with Flexbox wrapping,this ensures that the cards adjust into new lines on smaller devices.The images are proportionally scale (width: 100%) so they stay sharp without breaking the layout. Padding and margins are kept relative so spacing remains consistent across screen sizes.

Issues
I observed that some of the global styling in the project altered my own styling, this had resulted in the card clustering with no spacing or padding. The limited time has hindered me from fixing this bug, so my idea was not fully brought to life. Thanks for this opportunity.
