# Ecommerce Project

Layout Approach
The product cards were arranged using Flexbox . This ensures they align neatly in rows and wrapped automatically on smaller screens.I noticed some cards were bigger than others The space-around property keeps consistent spacing between cards, and equal height is maintained with align-items: stretch.

Responsiveness Considerations
The design adapts naturally with Flexbox wrapping,this ensures that the cards adjust into new lines on smaller devices.The images are proportionally scale (width: 100%) so they stay sharp without breaking the layout.I added padding to the parent div to help give the product card avoid clustering. I also made the "Add to Cart" button" more visible by gibing it a dark backround and a dark gray for hover. Padding and margins are kept relative so spacing remains consistent across screen sizes.
